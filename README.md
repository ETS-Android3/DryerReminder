# CST-451 - DryerReminder

The Dryer Reminder is my senior project that will use a Raspberry Pi 3, attached with a sense hat, to detect for lack of motion on a dryer. When it does so the dryer will use an API to send an alert to the user's android phone app, to give them a notification there.

The project is still in development and most of the code written is only for the python application on the Raspberry Pi.

Here is how every page of the android application relates to each other.
