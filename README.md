# CST-451 - DryerReminder

The Dryer Reminder is my senior project that will use a Raspberry Pi 3, attached with a sense hat, to detect for lack of motion on a dryer. When it does so the dryer will use an API to send an alert to the user's android phone app, to give them a notification there.

The project is still in development and most of the code written is only for the python application on the Raspberry Pi.
